# About

![Image title](assets/logo.png){ align=right }

I am Samsja a Machine Learning Engineer slightly obsessed with deep learning since a couple of years. Mainly coding in Python and Rust, building software for machine learning. 

My research interest lies in Multi Modal machine Learning, self supervised learning and (like, I guess, everybody else now) LLM.

I am currently working at [Jina AI](https://jina.ai/) as a Senior MLE.

### Software:

I am one of the main maintainers of [DocArray](https://github.com/docarray/docarray) and contribute to [Jina](https://github.com/jina-ai/jina). I maintain several other python and/or rust projects related to Machine Learning (Checkout my [github](https://github.com/samsja))

### Published Research:

* 2022: [Improving traffic sign recognition by active search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.14426) at [GCPR](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-16788-1_36) (German Conference on Pattern Recognition). Research conducted while working at [Zenseact](https://zenseact.com/)
