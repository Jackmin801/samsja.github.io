I am slightly obsessed with deep learning since a couple of years. Mainly coding in Python and Rust, mostly interested in:

* Efficient large language model
* Multi modality
* Self supervised learning in computer vision
* Programming language
* Squeezing performance out of hardware



## **Work**

I am currently training multi lingual LLM at [Nyonic](https://www.nyonic.ai/)

## **Software**:

I am one of the main maintainers of [DocArray](https://github.com/docarray/docarray) and contribute to [Jina](https://github.com/jina-ai/jina). I maintain several other python and/or rust projects related to Machine Learning (Checkout my [github](https://github.com/samsja))

## **Publication**:

* 2022: [Improving traffic sign recognition by active search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.14426) at [GCPR](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-16788-1_36) (German Conference on Pattern Recognition). Research conducted while working at [Zenseact](https://zenseact.com/) at the edges of image retrieval and active learning.
